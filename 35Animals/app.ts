//Exercise 45 Q 35
//Creating an Array
let petanimals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Cock tail"]
//Using For-Loop
//Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.
for(let onepet of petanimals){
//Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet.
    console.log(`A ${onepet} would make a great pet`)

}

//Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
//Print a message outside of For-Loop
console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet!")
