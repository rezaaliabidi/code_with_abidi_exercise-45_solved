//It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
//Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
//Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

type car = {
    manufacture: string
    model: string
    [key: string]: any;

}

function create_car(manufacture: string, model: string, optional: Record<string, any>): car{
    return{
        manufacture,
        model,
        ...optional
    }
}

const mycar: car = create_car("toyota", "corolla", {color: `black`, year: `2024`})
